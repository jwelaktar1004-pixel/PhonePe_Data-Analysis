### PhonePe Financial Services Dashboard: 2024 Analytics Project

**Project Overview**  
As a data enthusiast passionate about fintech innovation, I developed this comprehensive analytics project analyzing PhonePe's financial services dashboard for  2024 . Leveraging visualizations from a 5-page interactive dashboard (built in Tableau/Power BI), I extracted and synthesized key metrics on transaction volumes, processed amounts, success rates, and failure patterns across core services: Insurance, Loans & Credit, Money Transfers, and Recharges & Bills.

The project uncovers actionable insights into PhonePe's ecosystem, highlighting a total processed value of ₹6,673M across 371K+ transactions, with an overall 96% success rate. It identifies growth drivers (e.g., 15% MoM uplift in loan volumes) and bottlenecks (e.g., 97% failure in credit disbursals due to bank declines), positioning PhonePe for enhanced user experience and scalability in India's booming UPI landscape.  

**Key Insights & Highlights**  
- **Volume Leaders**: Loans & Credit dominated with ₹2,431M (36% of total), followed by Insurance at ₹513M.  
- **Reliability Benchmarks**: Recharges & Bills achieved 99% success (51K txns, ₹51M), ideal for high-frequency utilities.  
- **Trends**: Q1 showed steady 10-15% MoM growth, with peaks projected for Q4 (e.g., 13.7M in general services by Dec 2024).  
- **Failure Analysis**: 4% overall failures (15K txns) were driven by server errors (25-67%), user PIN issues (13-77%), and insufficient funds (3-60%)—opportunities for AI-driven predictions and UX tweaks.  
- **Projections**: With targeted fixes, expect 20% YoY volume growth and 99% success by Q1 2025.  

| Service | Total Amount (₹M) | Success Rate (%) | Top Failure Reason | Q1 Peak (₹M) |
|---------|-------------------|------------------|--------------------|--------------|
| General | 3,333 | 96 | Server Error (67%) | 11.5 (Mar) |
| Insurance | 513 | 47.8 | Wrong PIN (77%) | 1.4 (Mar) |
| Loans/Credit | 2,431 | 2.84 | Bank Declined (70%) | 8.5 (Mar) |
| Money Transfer | 378 | 70.5 | Insufficient Funds (45%) | 1.25 (Mar) |
| Recharges/Bills | 51 | 98.95 | Insufficient Funds (60%) | 4.0 (Mar) |

**Technologies & Approach**  
- **Data Extraction**: Parsed PDF dashboard visuals using Python (Pandas, Matplotlib) for quantitative aggregation.  
- **Visualization**: Replicated/enhanced charts in Tableau for interactive demos.  
- **Analysis**: Structured reports with trend forecasting via time-series modeling (e.g., exponential smoothing).  
- **Output**: Detailed executive report, presentation slides, and code notebooks for reproducibility.  

This project demonstrates my skills in data visualization, fintech analytics, and stakeholder storytelling—directly applicable to roles in product analytics or business intelligence.  


**Why This Matters**  
In a market where PhonePe processes billions daily, optimizing even 1% of failures could unlock ₹500M+ in annual value. This analysis aligns with RBI's digital payment push and showcases how data-driven decisions fuel financial inclusion.
